Senior Project- Simple Scheduler

		Application that tries to eliminate the hassel of meeting with a group by allowing for easier scheduling of the group.  The application
	will allow users to see their calendar and the calendar of everyone in the group.  This will allow people to get together
	without the need to sit there and try to reference a different calendar for personal or work lives.  
		The layout will be simple in nature and will not be overly populated.  This allows the user to know what they are looking at at all
	times and limit confusion.  Similarly, the widgets/fragments will display the information and the user can switch between what they would
	like to see on the fragment.
		The application allows users to enter their data from Google, Outlook, and by entering it themselves.  This allows many users to switch
  realitvely easily.  The tasks/ todo pages will be allowed to be exported to another application or shared via the phones interface.  
		This application runs similarily to Doodle Scheduler.  However, this is an application and that is just a website.
